                <p>Some theorists focus on a single overarching purpose of education and see the more specific aims as
                    means to this end.[22][20] For example, they may claim that socialization is the aim of education.
                    This means that education is seen as the process of transmitting accumulated knowledge from one
                    generation to the next. This process helps the student to function in society as a regular
                    citizen.[4][23][2] More person-centered definitions focus on the well-being of the student instead.
                    For them, education is a process that helps them lead a good life or the life they wish to
                    lead.[4][22][2] Various scholars stress critical thinking to distinguish education from
                    indoctrination.[20][21][24] For them, mere indoctrination is only interested in instilling beliefs
                    in the student, independent of whether they are rational.[20][19] Education, on the other hand,
                    should also foster the rational ability to critically reflect on those beliefs and question
                    them.[25] But some theorists contend that some forms of indoctrination may be necessary in the early
                    stages of education. It may be needed until the child's mind is sufficiently developed</p>

                <p>Tertiary education is also referred to as higher education. It expands upon the foundations of
                    secondary education but has a more narrow and in-depth focus on a specific field or subject. Its
                    completion leads to an academic degree. It can be divided into four levels: short-cycle tertiary,
                    Bachelor's, Master's, and doctoral level education. They often form a hierarchical structure with
                    later levels depending on the completion of previous levels.[54][39][55]

                    Short-cycle tertiary education focuses on practical matters. It includes advanced vocational and
                    professional training to prepare students for the job market in specialized professions.[56][39][57]
                    Bachelor's level education is also referred to as undergraduate education. It tends to be longer
                    than short-cycle tertiary education. It is usually offered by universities and results in an
                    intermediary academic certification in the form of a Bachelor's degree.[58][39][59] Master's level
                    education is more specialized than undergraduate education. Many programs require independent
                    research in the form of a Master's thesis as a requirement for successful completion.[60][39][61]
                    Doctoral level education leads to an advanced research qualification, normally in the form of a
                    doctor's degree. It usually requires the submission of a substantial academic work, such as a
                    dissertation.</p>

                <p>Education plays various roles in society, including in social, economic, and personal fields. On a
                    social level, education makes it possible to establish and sustain a stable society. It helps people
                    acquire the basic skills needed to interact with their environment and fulfill their needs and
                    desires. In modern society, this involves a wide range of skills like being able to speak, read, and
                    write as well as to solve problems and to perform basic arithmetic tasks. It also includes the
                    ability to handle information and communications technology. Children are socialized into society by
                    acquiring these skills. Another key part of socialization is to learn how to live in social groups
                    and interact with others by coming to understand social and cultural norms and expectations. This
                    requires an understanding of what kinds of behavior are considered appropriate in different
                    contexts. This way, new members are introduced to the culture, norms, and values that are dominant
                    in their society. Socialization happens throughout life but is of special relevance to early
                    childhood education. It enables a form of social cohesion, stability, and peace needed for people to
                    productively engage in their daily business. Education plays a key role in democracies by increasing
                    civic participation in the form of voting and organizing and through its tendency to promote equal
                    opportunity for all.[</p>
